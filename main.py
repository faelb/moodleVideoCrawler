This program crawls moodle for (Panopto!)Videos
and downloads them automatically.
Attention! This also downloads videos that
are restricted due to privacy issues - so please take care when using this program.
UseCase:
There are around 20 small (Panopto!)Videos on a lecture that is interesting and you assume the worst:
that this videos won't be available for you any longer when leaving university.
But downloading each and every video of all your lectures, to store them at your private cloud
is a pain in the a**. So this small program will do the downloading for you, and rename the video
just like it is namend on moodle.
